## we were not able to add a loading page to allow the user to know that he/she has to wait untill pinging other airlines because we have no time to add it and deploy it . We feel sorry for this not user friendly way. you have only to wait for a couple of minutes untill pinging has finished and also a couple of minutes untill pinging the other airline when booking external flights to be redirected to confirmation page .


## when choosing flight you have to choose a flight which is not today because our AWS has different time zone and we did not have time to fix it , so it will give you no flights with this criteria
