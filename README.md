# ionic: App

## in the payment page in the ionic app, the content of the page was shifted up, so the toggle for the "Visa" option is not visible on app but only visible if ran on browser, which leaves the app user only the "MasterCard" option, The statistics button on the home of the app redirected to something other than the statistics as the page for the statistics that was created wasn't added to the project as we didn't have time to merge it.Also, in the confirmation page you have to wait several seconds for the information to appear on the page.

## we were not able to add a loading page to allow the user to know that he/she has to wait untill pinging other airlines because we have no time to add it and deploy it . We feel sorry for this not user friendly way. you have only to wait for a couple of minutes untill pinging has finished and also a couple of minutes untill pinging the other airline when booking external flights to be redirected to confirmation page .


## when choosing flight you have to choose a flight which is not today because our AWS has different time zone and we did not have time to fix it , so it will give you no flights with this criteria
